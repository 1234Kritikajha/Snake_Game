# Snake_Game
This Java Swing program creates a classic Snake game with a 600×600 window and grid-based movement. A Timer updates the snake’s position, checks collisions, and redraws the screen. The player controls direction with arrow keys, eats randomly placed apples to grow and score points, and the game ends on wall or self-collision, displaying “Game Over.”
